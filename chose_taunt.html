        <p id="situation">You beat your brandished sword against your chest and yell at the couple. <br>
The beast commands his bear to stay where it is and approaches to calmly but with a sense of power. <br>
You are shocked at his approach and stand paralysed. <br>
He grabs your fists and plunges your sword deep into his chest. With his relaxed palm he collects a puddle of his blood and smears it across your forehead. <br>
He gurgles “you're ready, young cub.” as he slides off of your blade.<br><br>
