        <p id="situation">Just 50 feet away you see a man similar to the one who just tried to kill you.<br>
In his left hand he holds a club with a head larger than his, but this is not worrying.<br>
What worries you is in his right hand. As the man is holding the scruff of a bear's neck.<br>
You contemplate running but they have seen you.<br>
Do you..<br><br>
