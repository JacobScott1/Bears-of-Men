        <p id="situation">A red mist blurs your vision as you charge blindly into the eye of the storm.<br>
Needless to say, the beast charges too.
And so does his bear.<br>
As they reach you the bear raises onto its hind legs, the 10ft monster overwhelms you as you stand paralysed.<br>
With one fell swoop you are pinned to the ground as the bear proceeds to tear at your windpipe with is stone like teeth, as its handler saunters away.<br><br>
How foolish of you to start a fight with a man and his bear.
