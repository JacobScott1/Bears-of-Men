        <p id="situation">You follow smears of blood and discarded bodies for a few kilometers. <br>
Despite the fact that you have travelled many times in the past. <br>
You find yourself completely lost, but you journey has come to an end as you stand in front of a cave entrance. <br>
So dark you can barely see just two meters into the cave. <br>
You realise you must enter.<br><br>
