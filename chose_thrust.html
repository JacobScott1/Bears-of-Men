        <p id="situation">You thrust powerfully towards his navel.<br>
It proves useless as he grabs the blade with great power and great strength.<br>
His hand bleeds and drips blood down to the hilt of you weapon. <br>
He looks deep into your eyes and smiles, before his face drops to an expressionless scorn and he plants his foot into your skull.
